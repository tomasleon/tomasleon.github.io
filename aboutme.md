Welcome! My name is Tomás León. I'm currently a postdoc at UC-Berkeley in the [Marshall Lab](https://www.marshalllab.com) and a lecturer in the [UC-Berkeley Online MPH program](https://onlinemph.berkeley.edu/). My current postdoctoral work focuses on disease ecology, specifically the fine-scale movement of _Aedes aegypti_ and _Anopheles gambiae_ mosquitoes and the impacts of the environment on their population dynamics. This work is supported by the [DARPA Safe Genes program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/safe-genes) and the [UC-Irvine Malaria Initiative](http://malaria.bio.uci.edu/), as the consequences of this research have implications for the success of gene drives in mosquito populations for the disruption of malaria transmission and other mosquito-borne diseases.

Previously, I did my PhD in Environmental Health Sciences under [Robert C. Spear, who spent most of his recent career on schistosomiasis](https://schistoatberkeley.weebly.com/). I adapted and expanded his environmental determinants of transmission approach to the cases of opisthorchiasis (liver flukes) in northeast Thailand and clonorchiasis in southeast China, incorporating hydrological models into their infectious disease dynamics. In course of this research, I spent a year in Thailand for a Fulbright doing field work for this research.
