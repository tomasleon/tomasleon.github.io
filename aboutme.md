My name is Tomás León. I'm currently a postdoc at UC-Berkeley in the [Marshall Lab](https://www.marshalllab.com). My work focuses on the fine-scale movement of _Aedes aegypti_ and _Anopheles gambiae_ mosquitoes and the impacts of the environment on their ecology. This work is supported by the [DARPA Safe Genes program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/safe-genes) and the [UC-Irvine Malaria Initiative](http://malaria.bio.uci.edu/), as the consequences of my research have implications for the success of gene drives in mosquito populations for the disruption of malaria transmission and other mosquito-borne diseases.

Previously, I did my PhD in Environmental Health Sciences under [Robert C. Spear, who spent most of his recent career on schistosomiasis](https://schistoatberkeley.weebly.com/). I adapted and expanded his environmental determinants of transmission approach to the case of opisthorchiasis (liver flukes) in northeast Thailand and clonorchiasis in southeast China.
