Currently, I am serving as lead of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Modeling and Advanced Analytics Team on the COVID-19 response for the State of California. In this role, I am working to increase internal infectious disease modeling capacity at CDPH while also synthesizing and translating modeling evidence from external partners that impacts public health policy.
