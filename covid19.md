Currently, I am working as part of the California Department of Public Health Modeling Team on the COVID-19 response for the State of California.

Some resources that may be of interest, that include work I contributed to:

* [Nonpharmaceutical Interventions Remain Essential to Reducing COVID-19 Burden Even in a Well-Vaccinated Society: A Modeling Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.29.21254568v1)

* [Comparison of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.21251264v2)
