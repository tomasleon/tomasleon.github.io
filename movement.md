Releasing mosquitoes and other animals for mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiments is a popular way to understand dispersal. Modeling these movement processes while incorporating environmental factors is a major component of my current research. This gif is showing mosquitoes emanating out from a release location, like in an MRR or a gene drive mosquito release.
