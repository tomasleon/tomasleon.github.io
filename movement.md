Releasing mosquitoes and other animals for mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiments is a popular way to understand dispersal. Modeling these movement processes while incorporating environmental factors is a major component of my current research. These gifs show mosquitoes emanating out from release locations, like in an MRR or a gene drive mosquito release. Publication of simulation methodology forthcoming.
